JobInja is a job-matching platform designed for programmers. The core mechanism for assigning projects to users is based on an auction model. Each project specifies a list of required skills along with a maximum payment offer. Users with varying skill levels can place bids on projects, and the system ultimately selects the most suitable candidate for each project.
This project is a full-stack web platform designed as a job marketplace for developers, where freelancers can bid on projects based on their skills and qualifications. The frontend was initially built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, then transitioned to React for a more dynamic and interactive user experience. The backend was developed with Java, using JSP for server-side rendering before migrating to a RESTful API architecture. The system includes authentication with JWT, database integration with MySQL, and real-time project updates. The project also incorporates Docker for containerization, ensuring deployment efficiency in production environments. With features like automated auctions, skill endorsements, and API standardization, this project showcases my ability to design and implement a scalable, secure, and high-performance web application from concept to deployment.
