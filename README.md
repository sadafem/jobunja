# **JobInja: Job-Matching Platform for Programmers**

**JobInja** is a **job-matching platform** designed for programmers. The platform uses an **auction-based model** to assign projects to users. Each project comes with a **list of required skills** and a **maximum payment offer**. Programmers with varying skill levels can place bids, and the system automatically selects the **most suitable candidate** based on their bid and skills.

## ðŸš€ **Features**
### âœ… Full-stack Development
- Developed a **full-stack job marketplace** where programmers can **bid on projects** based on their skills and qualifications.
- Built with **Java (JSP)** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for the frontend. Later, migrated to **React** for a more **dynamic and interactive user experience**.

### âœ… Backend (Java + RESTful API)
- Initially developed using **Java (JSP)** for server-side rendering.
- Refactored the application to a **RESTful API** architecture for better scalability and separation of concerns.

### âœ… Frontend (React + Bootstrap)
- The user interface was first built with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, then transitioned to **React** to enhance interactivity and performance.

### âœ… User Authentication
- Implemented **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for **user authentication and authorization**.
- Handled user login, registration, and session management securely.

### âœ… Database Management
- Used **MySQL** to manage **user data, project details, and bid information**.
- Designed a **relational database schema** to efficiently manage project bidding logic.

### âœ… Auction-Based Logic
- Implemented an **auction-based project assignment system** where users bid for projects based on their skills.
- The platform automatically selects the **best-fit candidate** based on skill match and bid value.

### âœ… Containerization & Deployment
- Utilized **Docker** to containerize the application, ensuring seamless deployment in production environments.
- Improved scalability and ease of deployment.
